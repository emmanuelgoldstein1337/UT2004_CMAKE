# UT2004_CMAKE
The leaked Unreal Tournament 2004 source code was modified to compile with the modern MSVC compiler.


Currently works when compiled with the msvc_x86 toolset and the "Debug" build type.

To run the game, you need the "UT2004" folder beside the "UT2004_CMAKE" project folder, or edit the "System/UT2004_Game.ini" file to modify the game path.

KARMA Physics Engine, ForceFeedback, UnrealEd, and other stuff were disabled to make compilation possible.
